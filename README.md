# Fithub

## Overview
Fithub is a fitness companion app designed to guide beginners in their gym and yoga journey. The application helps users perform exercises correctly by leveraging real-time pose detection and analysis. With targeted exercise guidance, movement tracking, and a responsive chatbot for fitness-related queries, Fithub is your go-to app for improving form and tracking progress.

## Features
- **Exercise Guidance for Gym Beginners:**  
  Users can choose exercises from a list, learn about the muscles targeted by each exercise, and get real-time feedback on their form. The app counts reps only when exercises are performed correctly.
  
- **Pose Analysis for Yoga:**  
  Yoga beginners can receive guidance on correct postures. The app analyzes the user’s yoga poses using the same technology applied to gym exercises and provides feedback on alignment and positioning.

- **Real-Time Pose Detection:**  
  The app uses Google ML Kit to detect key joints and action points of the user’s body. By calculating angles between joints, Fithub evaluates whether the exercise or pose is being performed correctly.

- **Interactive Chatbot:**  
  The app includes a chatbot that answers queries related to diet, nutrition, and general fitness advice.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **User Interface:** XML
- **Pose Detection:** Google ML Kit
- **API:** Gemini API
- **Development Environment:** Android Studio

## How It Works
1. **Exercise Selection:** Users select an exercise from the list.
2. **Targeted Muscle Information:** The app provides details about the muscles targeted by the selected exercise.
3. **Pose Tracking and Analysis:** The app accesses the front camera and uses Google ML Kit to detect body joints in real time.
4. **Angle Calculation and Feedback:** The app calculates joint angles to determine if the user is performing the exercise correctly. Reps are counted only when the correct form is maintained.
5. **Yoga Guidance:** Similar pose detection is used for yoga beginners to guide them on proper postures.
6. **Chatbot Assistance:** The chatbot is available for quick queries related to diet and fitness.
